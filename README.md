# customer-management
Customer management full stack application with `Reflex` framework and `Neon` Postgres database.

## How we make it 
By using `Reflex`, we are able to build both frontend and backend fully by using `Python` and finally make the application data-driven by using `Neon` database.

As a recap, to connect to Neon from a Reflex app:
 1. Create a Neon project
 2. Set up a Reflex project
 3. configure Reflex connection settings(See: `rxconfig.py`)
